#Cricket Categorization

In this project, we create a clustering model to conert group data them into clusters based on their Strike Rate and Average.
Given to us is a dataset called CRICKET.csv which contains attributes of Strike Rate and Average as id and cluster id  

Using clustering, we are able to reach a 70% accuracy in predictions.

This project is part of the Edyst InternshipÂ Program.
